# SQLALCHEMY-CHALLENGE

I've decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I've decided to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that I took to accomplish this task.

1. I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of my climate database. Specifically, I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
2. Next I desiged a Flask API based on the queries that I just developed
